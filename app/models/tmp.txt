Hello Gem!

Okay, so, finally got all the tests to PASS, except the Likes model which we,
obviously, haven't yet designed let alone implemented! Okay, so, we need to make
a note to review the test sweet as I don't believe the tests are consistent
across all related models. IDK, maybe it's not an issue as I am new to using TDD.

Right, here's the new requirements:

Next steps:

1. We start every phase/section etc. by creating the TDD Tests.

2. Add a Likes model (pollymorphic assoc)

3. Nested Categories - for breadcrumb navigation and urls (e.g. vehicle/car/slug)?

4. I want users to be able to create their own groups/cricles of friends (a Groups model?)

4. The Stoic Quote data model (API). @see: github for Stoic quote projects we
   can emulate or at the very least acquire the quotes! I want to incorporate
   affiliate links to the books they come from on Amazon. (I want this to be an API)

5. Create the Tests for the App's Routes that we can deduce so far.

6. Incorporate from the start or develop along side an API for the eventual React front end.
